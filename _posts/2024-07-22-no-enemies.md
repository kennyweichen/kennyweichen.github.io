# I have no enemies

Today, I woke up at 6:09 am. I had ambitiously set my alarm for 6:00 am but snoozed it because I had an amazing dream. 
But I was not able to continue the dream after trying to go back to sleep, so I woke up at 6:09 am.
I go through my morning routine and I leave the apartment, grabbing my bike to go to work. 
As I bike along Lake Shore Drive, I notice this cyclical bumping motion in my back wheel. Was something caught on the tire? 
Was my lock that I awkwardly placed on the frame hitting the back wheel? 

I quickly pulled to the side and hopped off to inspect my bicycle. Unfortunately for me, there was no quick easy solution to my problem as I had a flat tire.

I've had my bike for about three weeks now and this was the first flat I've had since. I completely forgot that flats existed. 
That I live in a world where bikes need to be maintained and cared for. I was initially very shocked and stressed-- about how I was going to get to work,
about how I was going to fix this flat without any of the proper equipment. I hurridly walked my bike to the nearest store I could find that had an air pump so 20 minutes goes by and I arrive at a Target.

I grab the cheapest air pump I could find and quickly make my way back out to fix this tire. After a solid 10 minutes of trying to pump air into the tire, I give up and realize this was not something I could fix right now.

Luckily for me, I did not make it very far before my bike broke down so I walked the 20 minutes or so back to my apartment.

As I was walking, I found myself thinking, "why did this happen to me?" "What did I do to deserve this?" as if the Earth spun according to notions of justice and
morality. I tend to think in these retributive lens. 

"Oh, they did X, so Y should happen."

But after graduating and moving to Chicago and recovering from a herniated disc and running two half marathons and putting myself out there to meet new people and trying to be a better person and turning 24,
I quickly found myself to be extremely aware of myself thinking those thoughts and this image came into my mind.
