    "The standard procedure for shuffling a deck of cards is to take the pack face downwards in the left hand and then transfer each card one by one to the right hand, putting the second on top of the first, the third under, the fourth above, and so on until all cards are transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you perform this operation with an even number of cards and keep on repeating the shuffle in the same way, the cards will in due time return to their original order. Try with 4 cards and you will find the order is restored in 3 shuffles. In fact, where the number of cards is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, the number of shuffles to get them back to the original arrangement is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively.\n",

    "I notice that every card in an even index goes above the first card and every card in an odd index goes below so it splits the deck in half and reverses the order as you can see from the Base position to the First shuffle. Because we only have 4 cards meaning we can split the deck in half and have 2 cards in each pile, I think you can only change the order so many times. \n",

    "This took 6 shuffles. This makes me think (hope zealously) that a deck with 14 cards takes 14 shuffles. I think even numbers that are powers of 2 benefit from the implicit binary splitting of the deck, whereas other even numbers can't split it up quite as nicely.\n",

    "ahhhh, I was sort of on the right page with groups.... So each shuffle can be represented as a permuation on $$S_{14}$$, the symmetric group on 14 integers. In cylic notation, it would look like this: $$(1,14,13,11,7,2,12,9,3,10,5,6,4,8)$$. And since it is disjoint, this permutation has order 14 meaning 14 shuffles are required. \n",
