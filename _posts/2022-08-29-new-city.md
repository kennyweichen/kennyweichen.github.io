title: Finding OLS Estimators
tags: [statistics, regression]

I'm beginning a new school year and I'm currently taking a Regression class. It's honestly a review of a lot of stuff I've seen before and one thing we've covered is the OLS method of estimation which is near and dear to many of our hearts. However, it's been years (okay more like 3) since I've actually dervied it and I struggled initially. It required a few "tricks" or knowledge of how to rearrange or replace terms with other terms. So I decided to write it here in hopes I can remember it better.
