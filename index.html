Hi! my name is Kenny,  陈承熙, and this is my website where I'm putting everything about myself into one place. I'm a statistician, interested in how math can be used 
to do good in the world. A lot of my work is involved in exploring issues of public health, particularly children's health, and social justice. 
Though I now find myself more interested in seeing how I can use statistics and math in other spaces like finance and data science. 
But most importantly, I'm someone's son, brother, partner, and a person living for the first time. 
Still trying to figure out the best way to organize my website. Like life, it is a WIP.
