title: Kenny's Corner on the Internet
subtitle: This is where you can find my musing's, things I'm interested in, and ideas I'm pursuing. Often quarter-baked thoughts and my friends say I can't use them as my personal diary anymore. Firm believer of Murphy's law which states "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."
