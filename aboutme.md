I am a first year in the SM80 biostatistics program at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. I'm curious and optimistic about the possibilities that lie in the intersection between public health and statistics. 

I did my undergraduate at Amherst College where I double majored in mathematics and statistics. My undergraduate thesis is titled, "A Model-Free Dependence Measure for High-Dimensional Contingency Tables via the Checkerboard Copula and its Potential as a Goodness of Fit Measure" and I was graciously advised by Dr. Shu-Min Liao.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, strumming on my guitar, and aimlessly wandering wherever I am.
